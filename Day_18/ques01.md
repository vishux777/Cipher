### Question-01

You are tasked with creating a Person class in C++ that stores details of a person, such as firstName, lastName, and age.

The class should:

- Have a constructor that takes firstName, lastName, and age as arguments and initializes the member variables.
- Include a method `getFullName()` that returns the full name of the person (a concatenation of firstName and lastName).
- Add a method `getDetails()` that returns the firstName, lastName, and age in a tuple.
- Demonstrate the usage of structured bindings to unpack the tuple returned by `getDetails()`.
